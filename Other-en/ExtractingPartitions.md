## Boot into recovery

- If not already done, please proceed with the installing recovery as told in [Getting to Mass Storage Mode] section in [Main guide](/InstallWindows-en/InstallWindowsManually.md) for POCO X3 Pro. Come back once you're done.

- Reboot into recovery

Your POCO X3 Pro will boot into TWRP, touch will not work and the device will say it is locked. This is completely normal and expected.

## Retrieve the location of our boot partition

- We need to open a shell to issue commands directly to the phone. To do so, run the following command on your PC:

```batch
adb shell
```

You are now able to issue commands directly to your phone via your PC.

- Now, we need to find the location of our boot partition, as it is different for each device. To do so, run the following command on your PC:

```bash
ls /dev/block/by-name/
```

- This is going to output a lot of lines, with each partition name having its mount point. Look for the line that says `boot`

Let's make an image of the partition:

```bash
dd if=/dev/block/by-name/boot of=/tmp/boot.img
```

- Now let's exit the shell and pull the boot.img from the device, to do so, run the following command on your PC:

```bash
exit
```

```batch
adb pull /tmp/boot.img
```

If you did everything correctly, you will now have your `boot.img`. Enjoy! ðŸ¥³
