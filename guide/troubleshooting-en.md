# Running Windows on the POCO X3 Pro

## Troubleshooting Issues

## Charging in Windows does not work
> Charging in Windows only works on specific cables, regardless of whether USB host mode is on or off.

Cables that have been known to work are the original Poco X3 Pro cable (identified by the additional orange/red pin in the USB-A port), and the Nimaso 100W USB-C to USB-C fast charging cable.




## Device can boot into android but not bootloader

### Prerequisites:

- [ADB & Fastboot](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

This is caused by partitions with volume names the bootloader cannot handle, to fix this:

- Boot to recovery

- Connect phone to PC

- Open cmd on PC

- Run ```adb shell```

- Run ```parted```

- Run ```print``` to list all partitions

- Look for partitions that have spaces in the names e.g "Basic Data Partition" and note their volume number

- Now run ```rm <vol number>``` e.g ```rm 36```



## Touchscreen touches are inaccurate/upside down

You picked the wrong definitions file while installing drivers.

## Cannot mount the win partition in Android or WoA Helper doesn't work

- You may encounter an error when trying to mount the win partition
- "The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting.)
Could not mount read-write, trying read-only"

- If you have windows installed you have an "unclean file system"
- An unclean file system happens when windows is put in a hibernation state or you've done a force reboot
- To fix this simply reboot into windows and **REBOOT** from windows **NOT SHUTDOWN**
