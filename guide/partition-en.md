# Running Windows on the POCO X3 Pro

## Installation

## Partitioning your device

### Prerequisites

- [Modified TWRP](../../../releases/Recoveries)

- [ADB & Fastboot](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

### Notes
> [!WARNING]  
> If you ever delete any partitions via diskpart, Windows will send a UFS command which would erase the entire UFS storage!
> 
> All your data will be erased! Backup now if needed.
> 
> Do not run the same command twice.
> 
> DO NOT REBOOT YOUR PHONE if you think you made a mistake, ask for help in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/winonvayualt).
> 
>
> Do not run all commands at once, execute them in order!
>
> YOU CAN BREAK YOUR DEVICE WITH THE COMMANDS BELOW IF YOU DO THEM WRONG!!!

##### Flash the modified TWRP recovery
```cmd
fastboot flash recovery path\to\twrp.img
fastboot reboot recovery
```

##### Run the partitioning script

> If it asks you to run it once again, do so

```cmd
adb shell partition
```

#### Check if Android still starts
Just restart the phone, and see if Android still works
